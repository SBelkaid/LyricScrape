tree town.\n\nCome in from the darkness on the edge of this three tree town.\nBecause it\'s thicker than the woods out there,\nSettles harder than the cold winter ground.\n\nCome in from the shadows of these boot black, marching clouds\nBecause trouble falls like rain,\nAnd lately it\'s been pouring down.\n\nI\'ve seen loneliness\nShe wrapped me up with such tenderness\nI\'ve seen loneliness\nShe tied me down in her sweet caress.\n\nOh come in from the confines of your own mind my dear, because worry is all you\'ll find there it\'s clear.\nAnd tomorrow will always come.\nAnd tomorrow may well bring the sun.\n\nYeah i\'ve seen loneliness\nShe wrapped me up with such tenderness.\nAnd i\'ve seen happiness\nShe came round here yesterday\nIn a bright blue dress.\n\nAnd we go.',
